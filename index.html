  <p>
    I’m an attorney who helps people <strong>preserve, access, and share information</strong>.  
    I provide legal strategy for:  
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li>Universities, libraries, archives, and cultural institutions</li>
    <li>Nonprofits and foundations supporting open knowledge</li>
    <li>Public-interest digital startups and infrastructure projects</li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    I advise on copyright, licensing, publishing contracts, and fair use.  
    I also help organizations navigate the <strong>legal questions raised by artificial intelligence</strong> — 
    including the use of copyrighted works in training data, rights in outputs, and responsible approaches 
    to open access and innovation.  
  </p>

  <h2>Other Roles</h2>
  <p>
    I also serve as the Executive Director of 
    <a href="https://authorsalliance.org">Authors Alliance</a>, a nonprofit that supports authors who want to be read 
    and whose works benefit the world. I often write about copyright, publishing, and technology for 
    <a href="https://www.authorsalliance.org/category/blog/">Authors Alliance’s blog</a>.
  </p>

  <h2>Background</h2>
  <p>
    Previously, I was Duke University's Associate University Librarian for Research, Collections and Scholarly Communications 
    and Lead for Copyright and Information Policy. I was also a law librarian and Clinical Assistant Professor at 
    UNC Chapel Hill, where I still occasionally adjunct teach. Before that, I was part of a project at UC Berkeley School of Law, 
    <a href="https://www.law.berkeley.edu/case-project/digital-library-copyright-project/">the Digital Library Copyright Project</a>, 
    supported by the Alfred P. Sloan Foundation.
  </p>

  <p>
    I hold law and library degrees from UNC Chapel Hill and I’m licensed to practice in North Carolina.  
    My wife Janice and I live just outside Chapel Hill on <a href="https://www.hawriverfruit.com/">a farm</a> 
    with our five kids.
