<h1>David R. Hansen</h1>

</p>

<p>

I'm an attorney who helps people preserve, access, and share information. I'm also a librarian. I serve as the Executive Director of <a href="https://authorsalliance.org">Authors Alliance</a>, a nonprofit that supports authors who want to be read and who want to see their works benefit the world. I often write for the Authors Alliance on <a href="https://authorsalliance.substack.com/">Substack</a>.  

</p>

<p>

Previously, I was Duke University's Associate University Librarian for Research, Collections and Scholarly Communications and Lead for Copyright and Information Policy. I was also once a law librarian and Clinical Assistant Professor at UNC Chapel Hill, where I still occasionally adjunct teach. Before that, I was part of a project at UC Berkeley School of Law,  <a href="https://www.law.berkeley.edu/case-project/digital-library-copyright-project/">the Digital Library Copyright Project</a>, supported by the Alfred P. Sloan Foundation. 

</p>

<p>

I went to law school and library school at UNC Chapel Hill and I'm licensed to practice in North Carolina. My wife Janice and I live just outside Chapel Hill on <a href="https://www.hawriverfruit.com/">a farm</a> with our four kids.
