Previously, I was Duke University's Associate University Librarian for Research, Collections and Scholarly Communications.

Sloan Foundation.

I went to law school and library school at UNC Chapel Hill. My wife Janice and I live just outside Chapel Hill on <a href="https://www.hawriverfruit.com/">a farm</a> with our four kids.
